# Connect Payment Example

The Connect Payment Processor example requires a server which can be found in the `server` folder. To be able
to run the server Node.js needs to be installed on your system. You can download Node.js from their
[Webpage](https://nodejs.org).

After installing Node.js install the required dependencies by running the following command in the
`server` folder:

    npm install

Then the server can be started using:

    node server.js
